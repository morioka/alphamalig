ALPHAMALIG(<B>ALPHA</B>bet <B>M</B>ultiple <B>ALIG</B>nment) is a tool which allows you to align many but no more than 200 sequences. 
These sequences  will be formed  by characters of a  finite  alphabet.<br><br>
All  you  have  to do is upload a file with the sequences in FASTA format and another file with the information of <br>
the alphabet.
A limitation of ALPHAMALIG is that the original sequences <b>must not</b> be longer than 2000 characters.<br>
In fact, sequences shorter than 1800 chracters are strongly recommended. 
<br>
The web service will be no longer available but a tar file with the
source code and the running files for linux can be downloded <a
href="alphamalig.tar"> here </a>.
